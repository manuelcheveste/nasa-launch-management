# nasa-launch-management

Hi! This is a fullstack project about sending rockets to possible habitable
exoplanets.
Made the project following the course of [Complete NodeJS Developer in 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-nodejs-developer-zero-to-mastery) by [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ztm-academy/).

The code was written following the course, but modified some naming techniques where
I felt it was necessary and made some changes to the code to make it more readable and easy to startup for new developers like using npm-run-all package.

The purpose of this project was to learn more about _NodeJS_ and _ExpressJS_ and
much more.
